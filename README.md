# Weather Dashboard
Have you ever wanted an app for your computer to tell you what the weather is wherever you want it to? Look no further! This is your one stop shop! Just type in the city your interested in and you will get a 5 day forecast of it. Lets say you want to save this city to check on in the future. NO PROBLEM! This will save so if you come back later, your city will still be there.
## A look inside
Here's a picture of the application in action!
